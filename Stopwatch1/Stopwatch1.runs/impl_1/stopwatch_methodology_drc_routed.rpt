2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-23#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between s_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/I0 and s_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#2 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between s_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/I0 and s_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#3 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between s_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/I0 and s_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#4 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between s_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/I0 and s_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
